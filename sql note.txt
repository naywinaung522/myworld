python manage.py shell
>>> from members.models import Member

Hit [enter] and write this to look at the empty Member table:
>>> Member.objects.all()

This should give you an empty QuerySet object, like this:
<QuerySet []>

Add a record to the table, by executing these two lines:
>>> member = Member(firstname='Emil', lastname='Refsnes')
>>> member.save()

Execute this command to see if the Member table got a member:
>>> Member.objects.all().values()

Hopefully, the result will look like this:
<QuerySet [{'id': 1, 'firstname': 'Emil', 'lastname': 'Refsnes'}]>

Add Multiple Records
You can add multiple records by making a list of Member objects, and execute .save() on each entry:
>>> member1 = Member(firstname='Tobias', lastname='Refsnes')
>>> member2 = Member(firstname='Linus', lastname='Refsnes')
>>> member3 = Member(firstname='Lene', lastname='Refsnes')
>>> member4 = Member(firstname='Stale', lastname='Refsnes')
>>> member5 = Member(firstname='Jane', lastname='Doe')
>>> members_list = [member1, member2, member3, member4, member5]
>>> for x in members_list:
...   x.save()

Now, if you run this command:
>>> Member.objects.all().values()
